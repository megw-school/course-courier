# Course Courier

Course Courier is an application designed to streamline the process of managing academic assignments. Canvas is weidely used web-based learning management system where students can find and submit their assigned coursework. While it provides some task management capabilities, task managment is not one size fits all and everyone has their own preferences and preferred softwares for how they manage their tasks. This is where Course Courier comes in. Course Courier enables its users to copy their coursework from Canvas to the task management software of their chocie. Users can filter the assignments they want to copy and tailor how it will be organized in their task management software.

At the moment, Course Courier is optimized for integration with ClickUp. However, I would love to add more task management software integrations down the road. For those using other platforms, you can export Canvas data for easy import elsewhere.

## Project Background

I developed this application as part of portfolio assignment for Software Engineering I this past Fall. The idea for this was born out of a personal need to make assignment tracking more efficient. I found the process of migrating school tasks from Canvas to other systems tedious and time consuming and wanted to build a tool that autoamted the process, turning this activity into one that takes hours to one that takes minutes.

This project is definietly bigger than what the portfolio assignment called for, but I had a lot of fun building it out. I would love to one day host this publically, but for now it just runs locally as a personal tool. This is in part to comply with Canvas' API Terms and Conditions and also because I am not ready to manage secrets and tokens.
